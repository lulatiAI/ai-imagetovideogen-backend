🎬 AI Image-to-Video Generator

Turn static images into AI-generated videos in just a few clicks. This project powers the Image-to-Video page on Lulati.com
, allowing users to upload images and watch them transformed into high-quality videos using AI.

🚀 Features

Image-to-Video Conversion: Upload a single image and generate a dynamic AI video.

Cloud Storage: Uploaded images and generated videos are securely stored in Amazon S3 for reliable access.

Content Moderation: All uploaded images are automatically screened using AWS Rekognition and Lambda to ensure safe, appropriate content.

AI Processing: Images are processed using RunwayML to produce high-quality, customizable video outputs.

Real-Time Feedback: Users can track the status of video generation and receive updates as the process progresses.

Responsive Design: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.

Future-Ready: Built to integrate Stripe for monetization, support multiple AI models, and eventually become a mobile app.

🛠️ How It Works

Upload an Image: Users submit an image to the platform.

Moderation Check: The system automatically checks the image for inappropriate content using AWS Rekognition and Lambda.

AI Video Generation: If the image passes moderation, the AI generates a video using RunwayML.

Cloud Storage: Generated videos are securely stored in Amazon S3 for easy access.

Delivery: The final video is made available to the user for previewing and downloading.

Progress Tracking: Users and developers can see logs and updates on the generation process in real time.
